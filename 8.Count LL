Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList : 1->2->3->4->5

class Solution {
    // Function to find the length of the linked list.
    int getLength(Node head) {
        int count = 0; // Initialize the count of nodes.
        Node current = head; // Start with the head node.
        
        // Traverse the linked list.
        while (current != null) {
            count++; // Increment the count for each node.
            current = current.next; // Move to the next node.
        }
        
        return count; // Return the total count of nodes.
    }
}
